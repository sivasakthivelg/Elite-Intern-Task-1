Decision Tree Classification

This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at *ELiteTEch. The goal was to build and visualize a **Decision Tree* model using the Scikit-learn library to classify outcomes based on a given dataset.

Objective
To classify records using a decision tree and visualize the model's structure.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training and prediction
- Visualization of the decision tree
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
Output
- Decision tree diagram
- Model accuracy and insights
